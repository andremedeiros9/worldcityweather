# World City Weather

** Project Description **

A Web App where you can seek information about the weather, by city.

** Starting Point **

I wanted to learn vue.js, so I tried to do a tutorial of basic web app. I found a video on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLc-hWsPTUY - where I tried to follow and learn every step that it's taken. After understanding it, I tried to add some features that i thought of.

** The MVP for this web application: **

- Getting the city and country temperature, weather, weather icon and other weather specifications;
- Having 3 backgrounds, that change automaticly accordingly to the temperature - 1 neutral, 1 for temperature bigger and equal than 15, 1 for temperature under 15;
- Stylizitation (CSS) accordingly with what I wanted.

** Development **

My goal here is to learn vue.js. So I tried to distance myself from the tutorial. That's why I tried to add some features, wich, fortunately, gave me a little a bit of trouble, but that's what made me learn. And I'm quite happy about the final result. When I created the project in the terminal, it gave me the project already structured, and that helped a lot!

** New features: **

- Comparing weather between cities;
- Add more weather specifications;
- Background changing accordingly to the weather description (for example: If it's cloudly, change to a background image with clouds).
